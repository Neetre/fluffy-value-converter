## Description

This repository contains a project developed for Hack Club.

This is a Python program for a currency converter with a graphical user interface (GUI).
It uses the customTkinter library to create the GUI.

## Requirements

python >= 3.8

**Setting Up the Environment**

* Windows: `./start_Windows.bat`
* Linux/macOS: `./start_Linux.sh`

These scripts will install required dependencies, and build a virtual environment for you if you don't have one.
They will also start the app automatically.

## Running the Program (CLI or GUI)

### CLI

1. Navigate to the `bin` directory: `cd bin`

2. Execute `python converter.py [--help]` (use `python3` on Linux/macOS) in your terminal

    The `--help` flag displays available command-line arguments.

### GUI

Double click on the *start files* for your OS, and it should open a windows with a question after setting up the environment, like I wrote in the **Requirements** area. The window asks you to choose between the CLI and GUI.
